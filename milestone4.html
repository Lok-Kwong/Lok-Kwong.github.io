                        <li>User Stories</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>As a user I want to have and display events/classes on my calendar that grants me access to a corresponding zoom link or 
                                allow me to see a scheduled cohort time on the calendar so that I can
                                 keep track of what I'm doing next.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <p>In order to address this user story, we came up with a design that would tackle the problem of hybrid-synchronous classes, disorganization. 
                                The current view would allow the user a clear understanding of their month or week at single glance. The classes are color-coded along with any relevant information a student would need, 
                                such as the zoom link when participating online or the cohort location when choosing to engage physically.</p>
                            <li>As a user I want to be able modify classes/events on my calendar so that I can add
                                classes/events, delete classes/events, or edit existing times for certain days.</li>
                            <br>
                            <p> In order to address this user story, we created buttons and popups that simply allow the user to add a class or an event at a specific day and time. 
                                They have the option to put a class location or a zoom link that would automatically launch the online class.</p>
                            <li>As a user I want to be able to customize the theme of the app so that it is more
                                convenient to use.</li>
                            <br>

                                They have the option to put a class location or a zoom link that would automatically launch the online class.</p>
                            <li>As a user I want to be able to login into the zoom/calendar app in order to see my
                                schedule.</li>
                            <br>
                            <p>In order to address this user story, we simply created a startup and login screen for users to create and save their accounts.
                                 We also created a account creation screen to address the obvious problem of how the user would login without an account.</p>
                            <li>As a user I want to be able to control my calendar and it’s settings so that I have the
                                freedom to edit the interface to my liking.</li>
                            <br>
                            <p>For this user story, there was much more freedom in what we could. We implemented design features that allowed the user to control how they view their schedule, weekly or monthly. 
                                Comparing the design to Athena, we offer a much more pleasing and palatable way of viewing and controling how the user views their calander. They may also minimize the settings bar.</p>

                        <li>Research Question</li>
                        <p>Does the prototype satisfy the user’s demands and leave them satisfied with the product? </p>
                        <hr>

                        <li>Methodology</li>
                        <p>For our methodolgy, we want to be able to see user’s interactions first hand and have them test certain components to narrow down improving user experience.
                            In order to do that, we will ideally have a focus group to gauge how the participants feel or think about the hybrid synchronous format and show them our design.
                            An effective technique we would want to use would be to invite the users to think aloud (oncurrent think-aloud) about what they are doing as
                            they are performing the task (Shneiderman 180). This informal atmosphere of a think -aloud session is noted to be very pleasant and
                            often leads to many spontaneous suggestions for improvements. All of this will be done with both professors and students. 
                        </p>
                        <hr>

                        <li>Testing Procedures</li>
                        <p><b>Informed consent</b> is meant to guarantee voluntary participation in research and is probably the most important procedure to address privacy issues in research. 
                            Informed consent consists of three main components, which are adequate information, voluntariness, and competence. So our plan to deal with informed consent 
                            during the testing phase is by providing the subjects with a consent form. Also, informing the users that data collected will be used to improve the accessibility and usability of the product.
                        </p>
                        <p>This form will</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>disclose potential research subjects information needed to make an informed decision</li>
                            <li>facilitate the understanding of what has been disclosed</li>
                            <li>promotes the voluntariness of the decision about whether or not to participate in the research</li>
                            <li>include the expected length of time for the evaluation session</li>
                            <li>inform the subjects that the data is private/hidden and not any other kind of identification will be associated with data after it has been collected</li>
                            <li>inform that the participant can withdraw anytime, for any reason, or for no reason at all</li>
                        </ol>

                        <br>
                        
                        <p>For <b>data</b> collection, we plan to collect data using participant observation when we observe the subjects’ 
                            activity while using the product. Participant observation offers us context and a greater understanding of
                             what’s happening with the product. This will allow us to gather data like the product's navigability and 
                             each page's response time. We also plan to collect data by providing the subjects with a survey in a non-intimidating survey environment after using the product. 
                             The survey results provide a snapshot of the attitudes and behaviors, including thoughts, opinions, and comments about the 
                             product. Based on the valuable feedback from the subjects, it will allow us to improve the product. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <br>

                        <p>For our <b>analysis</b> we plan to perform Diagnostic analysis, which takes the insights found from study 
                            data and drills down to find the causes of those outcomes. We are using this type of analysis because it 
                            helps us identify all user’s patterns of behavior after using the product. The biggest advantage of using 
                            Diagnostic analysis is that it describes how a product performs based on user’s interaction and the feedback 
                            from the survey. Based on this analysis, we can determine whether the product’s prototype satisfies the user’s
                             demands and leaves them satisfied with the product.
                        </p>

                        <br>

                        <p>In a <b>pandemic</b> setting, the best way to conduct the testing procedure safely during a pandemic is by 
                            using a variety of tools for remote testing. For example, having the users join a zoom call and share their screen while using the product on their own computer. 
                            This makes everyone in the research feel more safer because it would eliminate any kind of contact between the users and us.                            
                        </p>
