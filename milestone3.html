                        <li>User Stories</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>As a user I want to have and display events/classes on my calendar that grants me access
                                to a corresponding zoom link or allow me to see a scheduled cohort time on the calendar
                                so that I can keep track of what I'm doing next.</li>
                            <li>As a user I want to be able modify classes/events on my calendar so that I can add
                                classes/events, delete classes/events, or edit existing times for certain days.</li>
                            <li>As a user I want to be able to customize the theme of the app so that it is more
                                convenient to use.</li>
                            <li>As a user I want to be able to login into the zoom/calendar app in order to see my
                                schedule.</li>
                            <li>As a user I want to be able to control my calendar and it’s settings so that I have the
                                freedom to edit the interface to my liking.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <li>Which user stories are the most relevant to your proposed solution?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>User story 1 is the most relevant user story to the proposed solution. Our proposed
                                solution is “easing the complexity” of students looking for the Zoom links and cohort
                                information of each of their individual classes.
                                Because many different courses use a different solution to send the Zoom link and cohort
                                information to their students, User story 1 states that the user is able to access their
                                course meeting information on a singular
                                platform in a calendar-like interface. In an article about scheduling and organization
                                in general, they talk about how planning a student schedule ahead of time has a payoff
                                of saved time and increased productivity [1].
                                This user story of organizing links and specific cohort times into a relevant schedule
                                coincides with the idea of easing the complexity of hybrid synchronous instruction.
                            </li>
                            <li>User story 2 is also very relevant to our proposed solution since being able to modify
                                all your classes together in a singular spot would aid in easing the transition into a
                                hybrid synchronous world. In essence, the story is
                                about adding, deleting, and editing classes or events that are relevant to the user. In
                                a college blog, an admissions communications coordinator for Cornerstone University
                                advocates for students to use calendars in order to stay
                                organized and have all of their classes, tests, and events in one place in order to
                                succeed and ease anxiety [2].
                                Having an online calendar that allows users to add their classes and events relevant to
                                them helps them stay organized, while deleting and editing allows for flexibility in
                                their schedule much like erasing or crossing off things
                                in a hand-written schedule. Modifying a calendar with a user’s schedule with their
                                specific online and in-person times is an important user story that allows our users to
                                ease the complexity of hybrid synchronous instruction.

                            <p>Ideation 3 is supposed to demonstrate the functionality of being able to delete an event from
                                the calendar solution. Being able to modify all the classes in a singular spot, such as being able to delete an
                                event from the calendar, this solution would help students ease into a hybrid synchronous classroom setting. In a sense,
                                this solution acts as a planner for students to use online. An article from verywellfamily, mentions how the use of
                                a planner can help "reduce stress" and "increase productivity [3]." Reduce stress and increased productivity are two
                                crucial things a college student needs when it comes to school in general. With hybrid synchronous classes, easing into this
                                new classroom setting can be stressful, thus having a calendar interface that can be modifiable to the student's needs
                                would be a great solution.

                        <p>As a group we chose Ideation 4 mainly because we want the user not to have singular popups

                            do so much clicking in order to access their schedule. By condensing it into a weekly
                            schedule they are able to not only have
