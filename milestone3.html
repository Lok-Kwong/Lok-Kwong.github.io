                    <ol>
                        <li>Introduce your problem</li>
                        <p>The problem our group came up with is the disorganized nature of having multiple Hybrid
                            Synchronous Classes. In a Hybrid Synchronous format,
                            this would amount to 4 separate zoom links and 4 different scheduled cohort times if a
                            student
                            took 4 classes. This is an issue for both instructor and students.
                            Students often find themselves wasting time hunting for zoom links or finding their
                            designated
                            cohort assignments through hundreds of emails or through ELC.
                            The confusing issue of cohorts is further exacerbated if the class rotates it's schedule of
                            designated times for groups of students to come.
                            This indirectly affects an Instructor's ability to teach if students are facing obstacles in
                            joining class online and in-person. </p>

                                    If it is our scheduled cohort time, we have to find the meeting place and start
                                    heading out towards the designated location. If not, we must scour for a Zoom link
                                    from either our mail or eLC and access the link.

                            Tasks performed would be logging in, seeing the Zoom interface, and accessing the
                            organizational tool consisting of the Zoom links
                            and schedule cohort times for the different courses. Users would benefit such as greater
                            convenience to the user as they wouldn’t have to go search for a
                            Zoom link to join a class. This would also increase engagement of the course from the
                            perspective of professors or instructors by eliminating obstacles students face
                            in joining class online or in-person.

                    <h3>B. Analysis of Existing Solutions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Describe existing solutions</li>
                        <p>Most professors have sent the Zoom links and information about the cohort times through
                            E-Mail. A pro of this solution is it is guaranteed that the information is always saved in a
                            central location. Another pro of this solution is that there is no need for the student to
                            sign into their eLC account to access the Zoom link and the meeting in the first place. The
                            cons of this solution is that the student would have to tediously search for every
                            individual Zoom link that corresponds to each of their classes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another solution is that professors have posted their Zoom links and cohort meeting times
                            through their eLC announcements page. The pros about this solution is that students can
                            easily navigate and access this information on their eLC page. The cons about this solution
                            is that the student would still need to go to each of their eLC class pages in order to
                            access such information or if the eLC page doesn’t actually have the zoom link or schedule
                            based on the instructor or professor.
                        </p>

                        <ol type="i">
                            <li> <i> Strive for consistency </i> - Everything about the solution should be consistent
                                including
                                color scheme to indicate whether it's online or in-person, control scheme , and layout
                                of the interface.
                            </li>
                            <li> <i> Seek universal usability </i> - Students and Professors can access this interface
                                regardless
                                of what device or platform they are using to view this interface.
                            </li>
                            <li> <i> Offer informative feedback </i>- Prompting the user to rate the meeting after their
                                meeting ends. Display “connecting” when joining a meeting or “exiting” when leaving a
                                meeting. Indication of a possible cohort time could also be prompted as well.

                            </li>
                            <li> <i> Keep users in control.</i> - The user has a wide range of actions to customize the
                                interface to their liking. The user could edit the zoom links, and rearrange times.
                            </li>
                            <li> <i> Reduce short-term memory load </i> - The student and professor’s schedule should
                                contain all relevant information into one interface which includes all the zoom links
                                and cohort times
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>C. Proposed Solution</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Propose a solution</li>
                        <p>Hybrid Synchronous Classes are more complex than the traditional face-to-face instruction
                            we're used to, so our goal is to ease the complexity for students and instructors in order
                            to facilitate learning. Due to the disorganized nature of how Zoom links and cohort times
                            are being sent to students, the solution to the problem is for students to have access to a
                            Zoom interface that contains the necessary materials and information to be organized in a
                            hybrid-synchronous classroom setting. This interface would include a calendar-like view
                            displaying Zoom links and cohorts information for every course the student is currently
                            registered for. The signifiers would include hyperlinks of the Zoom, buttons to edit the
                            interface or schedule, and blocks on the dates that signify that you can add/delete/edit
                            events or specific dates that might be important. Our solution would afford the user to have
                            a singular place to view their upcoming schedule for the semester, as well as incorporating
                            and accommodating the user virtually and physically.

                        </p>


                        <li>How will we measure success</li>
                        <p>
                            Success is measured by how quickly and efficiently a student navigates to their Zoom link
                            and attends the corresponding lecture.
                            We can also measure success by seeing how many students actually use the interface or engage
                            with the interface.

                        </p>
