                    <h4>A. Task/Problem Definition</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Introduce your problem</li>
                        <p>The problem our group came up with is the disorganized nature of having multiple Hybrid
                            Synchronous Classes. In a Hybrid Synchronous format,
                            this would amount to 4 separate zoom links and 4 different scheduled cohort times if a
                            student
                            took 4 classes. This is an issue for both instructor and students.
                            Students often find themselves wasting time hunting for zoom links or finding their
                            designated
                            cohort assignments through hundreds of emails or through ELC.
                            The confusing issue of cohorts is further exacerbated if the class rotates it's schedule of
                            designated times for groups of students to come.
                            This indirectly affects an Instructor's ability to teach if students are facing obstacles in
                            joining class online and in-person. </p>
                        <li>Identify your potential users</li>
                        <p>
                            Students and teachers who are taking/teaching hybrid synchronous classes respectively are
                            affected by this study.
                            Tasks performed would be logging in, seeing the Zoom interface, and accessing the
                            organizational tool consisting of the Zoom links
                            and schedule cohort times for the different courses. Users would benefit such as greater
                            convenience to the user as they wouldnâ€™t have to go search for a
                            Zoom link to join a class. This would also increase engagement of the course from the
                            perspective of professors or instructors by eliminating obstacles students face
                            in joining class online or in-person.
